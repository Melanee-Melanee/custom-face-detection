# My-Face-Detection-Project
I have coded a program that can detect faces without creating datasets!
In this project, my program is received an image as a main image and then can compare it with the test image and recognise it who is she/he.
I can not share my source code for free since I have spent much time for this project but if anyone who is interested in my project can contact me (check my profile).  


Sincerely, Melanee
